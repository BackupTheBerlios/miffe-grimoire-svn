          DESC="bbconf is a GUI configurator for the Blackbox window manager.
It's written in C++ and Qt, and uses plugins for extensibility. 
bbconf is distributed with 4 plugins, and replaces the previously 
separate Blackbox/bbkeys configurators called toolbox and bbkeysconf. 
The plugins that come with bbconf are: a theme editor (which replaces 
toolbox), a keybinding editor modelled after the KDE keybinding editor 
(which replaces bbkeysconf), a preferences editor for bbconf itself, 
and a Blackbox menu editor. As time permits, more plugins will be 
written for bbconf that will allow configuration of all aspects of 
Blackbox sessions, including Blackbox's rc-file, bbpager, etc.
