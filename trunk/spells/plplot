      DESC="plplot is a scientific plotting package.

PLplot is relatively small, portable, freely distributable, 
and is rich enough to satisfy most users.  It has a wide 
range of plot types including line (linear, log), contour, 
3D, fill, and almost 1000 characters (including Greek and
mathematical) in its extended font set.  The package is 
designed to make it easy to quickly get graphical output; 
only a handful of function calls is typically required.  
For more advanced use, virtually all aspects of plotting
are configurable.

The PLplot library is written in C, enabling it to run on 
many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran 
programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided 
to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification 
of the user program.  C programs are required to include the 
header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details.  
Programmes written in many other languages can also use the
PLplot library.  The C++, Tcl, Python, Octave, and Yorick 
(this front end is maintained independently, see yplot.sf.net) 
front ends to PLplot are mature, the Java front end is almost 
there (most examples work), and the Perl front end is still 
quite incomplete.
