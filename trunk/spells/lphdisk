          DESC="lphdisk prepares a hibernation partition for APM Suspend-To-Disk
on laptops with Phoenix NoteBIOS. While one does not need this 
utility to use this notebook feature, if the memory 
size ever changes, disk gets upgraded/repartitioned, the hibernation 
partition may need to be recreated. Until now, this could only be 
accomplished by booting off of a DOS floppy and using a buggy utility 
called PHDISK.EXE provided either straight from Phoenix Technologies or 
the hardware manufacturer/distributor.
