The aim of the AutoTrace project is the development of a freely available application with a functionality similar to CorelTrace or Adobe Streamline. I hope that it will become better than all commercially available programs.  In some aspects it is already better.
AutoTrace is free software. AutoTrace is distributed under the term of GNU GPL.
