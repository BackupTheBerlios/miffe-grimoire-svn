Insight is a powerfull GUI debuger allowing you to
easily debug your application. it's a gdb frontend.
It has easy watchpoint adding mechanism (right clik
and select add, or select whole expression and right
click then add) debugging can be done in source mode,
assembler mod or a mix of both. The only problem you
can find is that's impossible to run application with
args...
and source is'nt hightlighted
this is the only working front end I found (ddd 
doesn't compile for me anymore)
