      DESC="qpopper is the most widely-used POP3 server for UNIX, Linux, etc.

qpopper's goals are: security, stability, safety, features, and 
performance.

The 3 and later code base has multiple levels of protection 
against common security vulnerabilities, so even if there 
is a bug at one level, the other levels can protect against 
an exploit.  Stability means running without crashing or
other problems.  All bug reports are reviewed and taken 
seriously.  Safety means protecting the user's mail.  
Qpopper takes extra precautions to guard against spool 
corruption, even if there is a system crash or power 
failure during an update.  Qpopper provides a large 
number of features, such as bulletins, support for 
wireless devices, APOP, integration with packages such 
as Kerberos, drac, etc.  Qpopper strives for the maximum 
possible performance consistent with safety.  You can 
also tell Qpopper when it is running in an environment 
where some precautions are not required, resulting 
in extra performance (for example, if users do not 
access mail using shell accounts).

This server is fully compliant with RFC 1939 (which 
defines the POP protocol) and RFC 2449 (which defines 
the POP extension mechanism and the extended response 
codes), and works with all known POP3 clients.

Qpopper also supports Kerberos V4 and V5 if enabled.  
You can obtain a Kerberos engine for your system from 
the MIT Kerberos Distribution Page.
