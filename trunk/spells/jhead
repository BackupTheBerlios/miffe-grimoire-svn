       DESC="jhead is a command line driven Exif header parser and manipulator

Jhead is a command line driven utility for extracting digital 
camera settings from the Exif format files used by many digital 
cameras. It handles the various confusing ways these can be 
expressed, and displays them as F-stop, shutter speed, etc. 
It is also able to reduce the size of digital camera JPEGs 
without loss of information, by deleting integral thumbnails 
that digital cameras put into the Exif header. If you need to 
add Exif support to a program, this is a simple program to cut 
and paste from. Many projects, including PHP, have reused code 
from this utility.
