    DESC="driftnet sniffs network traffic and picks out images from TCP streams

Driftnet is inspired by EtherPEG (though, not owning an Apple Macintosh,
I've never actually seen it in operation), Driftnet is a program which
listens to network traffic and picks out images from TCP streams it observes.
Fun to run on a host which sees lots of web traffic.
