      DESC="$SPELL provides tools for the kernel laptop mode.

Laptop mode (also known as laptopmode, laptop-mode and 
laptop_mode, for search engine purposes :) ) is a kernel 
mode that allows you to extend the battery life of your 
laptop. It does this by intelligently grouping write activity 
on your disks, so that only reads of uncached data result in a 
disk spinup. It causes a significant improvement in battery 
life (for usage patterns that allow it)."
