          DESC="hot-babe is a graphical utility which displays system activity
in a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a 
dressed girl, and when the activity goes up, as the 
temperature increases, the girl begins to undress, 
to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 
100%. Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't 
use it!
