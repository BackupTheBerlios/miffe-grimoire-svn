     DESC="$SPELL is a library that provides a framework for developing dockapps

It provides functions and structures to define and display 
command-line options, create a dockable icon, handle events, etc.
The goal of the library is to provide a simple, yet clean interface 
and standardize the ways in which dockapps are developed. A dockapp 
developed using libDockApp will automatically behave well under most 
window managers, and especially well under Window Maker.
