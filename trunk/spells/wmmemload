    DESC="wmmemload is a dockapp monitors memory/swap usage
wmmemload is a simple dockapp for WindowMaker on
X Windows that displays memory and swap space usage. It is very
heavily based on WMMemMon and WMCPULoad by Seiichi SATO. In fact
99% of the code is take from his applications (which I have used for
a while). I simply wanted numbers instead of a graphical display
for my memory statistics.
