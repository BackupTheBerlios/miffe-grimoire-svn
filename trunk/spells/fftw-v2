      DESC="fftw-v2 is the fast fourier tranform C library.

fftw-v2's API is incompatible with that of version 3.
It is also necessary for users who require MPI parallel
transforms (not yet added to version 3).

fftw, is the is a fast fourier transfer C library.
It includes complex, real, and parallel transforms, 
and can handle arbitrary array sizes efficiently.
FFTW is typically faster than other publically-available FFT 
implementations, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned 
libraries (benchmarks are available at the homepage).
To achieve this performance, FFTW uses novel code-generation and 
runtime self-optimization techniques (along with many other tricks).
