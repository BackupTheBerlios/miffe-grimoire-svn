          DESC="rxvt is a color vt102 terminal emulator

rxvt is an 8-bit clean, color xterm replacement that uses significantly 
less memory than a conventional xterm, mostly since it doesn't support 
toolkit configurability or Tek graphics, but also since features can be 
removed at compile-time to reflect your needs.
