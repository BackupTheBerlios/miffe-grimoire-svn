          DESC="spicctrl sets up LCD brightness on Sony VAIO laptops

spicctrl is a small program that can use the Sony Programmable I/O Control 
device (SPIC), which is part of Sony Vaio's, to do a few simple things. 
Currently, it can only be used to control the brightness on the LCD 
backlight, and print out some information about the battery.

You need a kernel with the sonypi module (and a Vaio laptop..) 
to use this program.
