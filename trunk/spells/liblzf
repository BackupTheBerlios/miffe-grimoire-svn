      DESC="liblzf is a very small and fast data compression library.
It consists of only two .c and two .h files and is very 
easy to incorporate into your own programs. The 
compression algorithm is very, very fast, yet still 
written in portable C.

liblzf is an ideal library for the following 
applications:
1. Fast, real-time compression, where liblzf can save 
I/O without costing too much CPU time.
2. Block compression. If you have repeated blocks of 
data (IP packets, application state etc..), then 
liblzf is ideal to decrease the size at a very small 
cost, as liblzf is basically free on modern cpus.
