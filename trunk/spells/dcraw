          DESC="dcraw decodes raw images from digital cameras

dcraw decodes any raw image from any digital camera. All digital 
cameras made since 1997 produce JPEG images but there are some
disadvantages. JPEG is a lossy format, a lot of information is
thrown away. That's why midrange and high-end digital cameras 
offer an alternative: Raw, unprocessed CCD data files, for which
the camera manufacturer provides special decoding software and 
there is no source code. However, dcraw is free and became a 
standard tool within and outside the Open Source world.
It's small (about 3000 lines), portable (standard C libraries 
only), free, and when used skillfully, produces better quality 
output than the tools provided by the camera vendor.
