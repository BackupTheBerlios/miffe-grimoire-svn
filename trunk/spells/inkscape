      DESC="$SPELL is a SVG vector graphics editor
with capabilities similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or 
Xara X. It uses the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file
format. Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, 
clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and grouping. 
Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, node editing, 
layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, text-on-path, flowed 
text, direct XML editing, and more. It imports formats such as JPEG, 
PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based 
formats.
Inkscape's main goal is to create a powerful and convenient drawing tool 
fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards. It also aims to 
maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open, 
community-oriented development process, and by making sure Inkcape is 
easy to learn, to use, and to extend.
