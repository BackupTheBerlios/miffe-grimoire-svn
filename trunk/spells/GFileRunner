       DESC="GFileRunner is GNOME-based file manager
aimed to be a nicer, faster, and more powerful replacement
for the current popular file manager, Nautilus.

Currently it does much of the things that Nautilus does, 
but faster. Some things are slower. Some things don't work. 
And some things aren't done.

It's not much yet, but it should be about half usable and 
definitely give people with lesser machines hope.
