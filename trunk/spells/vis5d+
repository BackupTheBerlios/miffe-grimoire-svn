     DESC="$SPELL a volumetric visualization program for scientific datasets
in 3+ dimensions. Vis5d+ is intended as a central repository 
for enhanced versions and development work on Vis5d. This 
project started out, with the blessing of the original Vis5d 
developers, as a conversion of Vis5d's build process to use 
GNU autoconf and automake. (Inspired by the difficulty of 
getting Vis5d to compile on the author's LinuxPPC PowerBook.) 
It quickly became apparent that many other enhancements were 
possible, and were of wide interest to users. Moreover, a 
large number of enhanced versions to Vis5d exist that have 
not been merged into the original Vis5d sources, due to time 
and resource limitations of the original developers, or to 
differences of opinion about design directions.
