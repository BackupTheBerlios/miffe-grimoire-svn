     DESC="cinepaint (former Film Gimp) is a motion picture editing tool.

CinePaint is a free open source painting and image retouching 
program designed to work best with 35mm film and other high 
resolution high dynamic range images. It is the most popular 
open source tool in the motion picture industry -- used in 
2 Fast 2 Furious, Scooby-Doo, Harry Potter, Stuart Little and 
other feature films. CinePaint is used for painting of 
background mattes and for frame-by-frame retouching of movies. 
It is being extended to do film restoration.

Animation renderers and 35mm film scanners are capable of 
creating greater color bit-depth than can be displayed on 
monitors (8-bit per channel) or can be manipulated in most 
programs. The 32-bit per channel color capacity of CinePaint 
appeals most to cinematographers and professional still 
photographers. However, CinePaint is a general-purpose tool 
useful for working on images for motion pictures, print, 
and the Web. CinePaint supports many file formats, 
conventional formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and TGA 
images -- and more exotic motion picture digital 
intermediate formats such as Cineon and OpenEXR.
