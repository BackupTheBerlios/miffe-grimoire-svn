    DESC="Yadex is a Doom level (wad) editor
for Unix systems running X, including Linux. It supports Doom 
alpha, Doom beta, Doom, Ultimate Doom, Final Doom, Doom II, 
Heretic and also, in a more or less limited way, Hexen and Strife. 
It is available under the terms of the GPL.

Yadex is descended from DEU 5.21. Therefore, as you might expect, it's a
rather low-level editor that requires you to take care of a lot of detail
but on the flip side allows you to control very precisely what you are
doing. In addition, it has many advanced functions that DEU didn't have,
to make certain tedious tasks easy.
