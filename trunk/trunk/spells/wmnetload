    DESC="wmnetload is a dockapp network interface monitor
for Window Maker.
It is designed to fit well with dockapps like wmcpuload and wmmemmon.
It tracks whether the interface is functioning and displays current network
interface throughput, along with an auto-scaling graph of recent network
activity (the graph separates upstream and downstream traffic load cleanly
without resorting to colors).
